## Introduction

The Group API is a method of getting access to descriptions of sets of people and/or subgroups, such as families, organizations, companies, departments or any other identifiable set of actors.  The Group model is of average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, plus a few more specific fields.  This results in an average complexity API, which is very similar to the [Person API](../person/), that can result in reasonably long JSON responses if all of the fields have values. 

For more information about the usage of Group data, please see the [Group model](/model/actor/) description.


## Property Definitions

Dereferencing an entity via the Group endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.
