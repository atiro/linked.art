## Introduction

Places are a foundational aspect of the Linked Art model for providing context as to where activities occur. They are extents in space described by a geometry, and independent of time or what object(s) may be present at the location. Places are a relatively simple model and therefore a relatively simple API, using the shared features and common patterns, along with a WKT based definition of the geometry.

For more information about the usage of Places, please see the [Place model](/model/place/).

## Place Property Definitions

| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `@context`        | string, array | Required    | The value MUST be the URI of the [Linked Art context](../../json-ld/) as a string, `"https://linked.art/ns/v1/linked-art.json"` or an array in which the URI is the last entry to allow for [extensions](../../json-ld/extensions.html) | 
| `id`              | string        | Required    | The value MUST be the HTTP(S) URI at which the place's representation can be [dereferenced](../../protocol/) |  
| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class of the place, which MUST be the value `"Place"` |
| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the place, intended for developers |
| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a classification of the Place and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../../shared/type/) |
| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name of the Place and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the Place and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/) |
| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a human readable statement about the Place and MUST follow the requirements for [Statement](../../shared/statement/) |
| `defined_by`      | string        | Optional    | A string containing the [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) representation of the geometry of the Place |
| `approximated_by` | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an approximation of the current Place and MUST follow the requirements for an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to a Place |
| `part_of`         | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Place that the current Place falls within and MUST follow the requirements for an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to a Place |
| `member_of`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Set that the current Place is a member of and MUST follow the requirements for an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to a [Set](../../endpoint/set/) |


## Example

The location for the city of Los Angeles could be described as below.

* It has a label "Los Angeles" for humans reading the JSON
* It is classified as a City (_aat:300008389_)
* It is called "Los Angeles"
* It has an identifier "06-44000"
* It is defined by a particular WKT Polygon
* It has a description (_aat:300411780_) of "Los Angeles is the largest city ..."
* It is approximated by the centroid place of Los Angeles
* It is part of the place California
* It is a member of the set of top 10 cities in the USA


```crom
top = vocab.City(label="Los Angeles")
top.identified_by = model.Name(content="Los Angeles")
top.identified_by = model.Identifier(content="06-44000")
top.referred_to_by = vocab.Description(content="Los Angeles is the largest city in California.")
top.defined_by = """POLYGON((-118.574 34.185,-117.558 34.185,-117.5585 33.512,-118.574 33.512,-118.5745 34.185))"""
top.approximated_by = model.Place(label="Los Angeles Centroid")
top.part_of = model.Place(label="California")
top.member_of = model.Set(label="Top 10 Cities in USA")
```
