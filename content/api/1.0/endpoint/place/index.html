## Example


```crom
top = vocab.City(label="Los Angeles")
top.identified_by = model.Name(content="Los Angeles")
top.identified_by = model.Identifier(content="06-44000")
top.referred_to_by = vocab.Description(content="Los Angeles is the largest city in California, and second largest metropolitan area in the USA.")
top.defined_by = "POLYGON((-118.57486466386725 34.18579234820859,-117.55862931230475 34.18579234820859,-117.55862931230475 33.51288983196726,-118.57486466386725 33.51288983196726,-118.57486466386725 34.18579234820859))"
top.approximated_by = model.Place(label="Los Angeles Centroid")
top.part_of = model.Place(label="California")
top.member_of = model.Set(label="Top 10 Cities in USA")
