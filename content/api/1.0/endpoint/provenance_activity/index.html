## Introduction

The Provenance Activity API is a method of getting access to descriptions of ... The API is of higher than average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, but also with a series of classes which convey parts of the higher level activity, each with their own unique properties.

## Property Definitions

Dereferencing an entity via the Provenance Activity endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.

## Example


```crom
top = model.Activity(ident="auto int-per-segment", label="")
n = model.Name(content="")
top.identified_by = n
