## Introduction

The Provenance Activity API is a method of getting access to descriptions of ... The API is of higher than average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, but also with a series of classes which convey parts of the higher level activity, each with their own unique properties.

## Property Definitions

Dereferencing an entity via the Provenance Activity endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.

### Properties of Provenance Activities

#### Required Classification

In order to determine that the activity is a Provenance Activity, rather than a more general Event or Activity, which would follow the [event](../event/) API instead, the Activity MUST have a `classified_as` entry with an `id` of `"http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300055863"`.

top = vocab.ProvenanceEntry(ident="auto int-per-segment", label="Provenance Activity")
