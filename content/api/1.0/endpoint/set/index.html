## Introduction

The Set API is a method of getting access to descriptions of sets or collections of any sort of entity, including especially objects, texts and images.  The Set model is relatively simple with many familiar properties and patterns, and very few additions.  

For more information about the usage of Set data, please see the [Collection model](/model/collection/) description.


## Property Definitions

Dereferencing an entity via the Set endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.

### Properties of Sets

| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `@context`        | string, array | Required    | The value MUST be the URI of the [Linked Art context](../../json-ld/) as a string, `"https://linked.art/ns/v1/linked-art.json"` or an array in which the URI is the last entry to allow for [extensions](../../json-ld/extensions.html) | 
| `id`              | string        | Required    | The value MUST be the HTTP(S) URI at which the set's representation can be [dereferenced](../../protocol/) |  
| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the set, which MUST be the value `"Set"` |
| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the set, intended for developers |
| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a classification of the set and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../../shared/type/) |
| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name of the set and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the set and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/) |
| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a human readable statement about the set and MUST follow the requirements for [Statement](../../shared/statement/) |
| `equivalent`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an [entity reference](../../shared/reference) to an external identity and description of the current set |
| `representation`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Visual Work](../visual_work) that represents the current set, and MUST follow the requirements for an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) |
| `member_of`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Set that the current set is a member of and MUST follow the requirements for an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to a Set |
| `subject_of`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to either a [Digital Object](../digital_object/) or a [Textual Work](../textual_work/), the content of which focuses on the current set, and MUST follow the requirements for an [entity reference](../../shared/reference) |
| `attributed_by`   | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Relationship Assignment](../../shared/assignment/) that relates the current set to another entity |
| `dimension` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Dimension](../../shared/dimension), such as total number of members, of the current set |
| `created_by` | json object | Optional | A json object representing the creation of the set, which follows the requirements for Creations described below. | 


### Properties of Creations

| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `id`              | string        | Optional    | If present, the value MUST be a URI identifying the creation  |  
| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the creation, which MUST be the value `"Creation"` |
| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the creation, intended for developers |
| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name for the creation and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the creation and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/) |
| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the creation and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) |
| `timespan`        | json object   | Recommended | A json object recording when the creation occured, which MUST follow the requirements for [timespans](../timespan/)|
| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an embedded [statement](../statement/) about the creation |
| `took_place_at`   | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to a [Place](../place/) where the creation occured |
| `caused_by`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to an [Event](../event/) that caused the creation to occur |
| `influenced_by`   | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to an entity that influenced the creation in some noticable fashion | 
| `carried_out_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to a [Person](../person/) or [Group](../group/) that created the set |

### JSON Schema

See the [schema documentation](../../schema_docs/set.html) and the [schema itself](../../schema/set.json)


### Incoming Properties

Set instances are typically found as the object of the following properties, other than the self-referential properties above.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases where other endpoints refer to groups.

| Property Name              | Source Endpoint | Description |
|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `member_of`                |  |  |


## Example


```crom
top = model.Set(ident="auto int-per-segment", label="")
n = model.Name(content="")
top.identified_by = n



```
