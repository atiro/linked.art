## Introduction

The Visual Work API is a method of getting access to descriptions of image content, such as the appearance of paintings and two-dimensional artworks, sculptures and three-dimensional artworks, or digital images.  The Visual Work model is of average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, plus several additions to describe the visual work's relationship to other entities.  

For more information about the usage of Visual Work data, please see the [Object Aboutness model](/model/object/aboutness/) description.


## Property Definitions

Dereferencing an entity via the Visual Work endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.

### JSON Schema

See the [schema documentation](../../schema_docs/image.html) and the [schema itself](../../schema/image.json)


### Incoming Properties

Visual Work instances are typically found as the object of the following properties, other than the self-referential properties above.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases where other endpoints refer to image content.

| Property Name              | Source Endpoint | Description |
|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `representation`           | All             | Entities can be represented in visual content, in other words the content of an image that depicts them. |
| `shows`                    | Physical Object | A physical object can show visual content |
| `digitally_shows`          | Digital Object  | A digital object, similarly, can digitally show visual content | 


## Example

The JSON for a Visual Work entry for a visual content of Miro's "The Farm" could be as below.

* It has the Linked Art context document reference in `@context`
* It self-documents its URI in `id`
* It has a `type` of "VisualItem"
* It has a `_label` with the value "Appearance of Miro's The Farm" for people reading the JSON
* It is `classified_as` "Cubist", which has an `id` of "aat:300021495", which is in turn `classified_as` being a Style ("aat:300015646")
* It is `identified_by` a `Name`, with the content "Appearance of The Farm"
* It is `referred_to_by` a statement which ...
  * ... has `content` of "A brilliant amalgamation of an intense ..."
  * ... is `classified_as` a Description ("aat:300411780")
* It `represents` a Place, Mont-roig del Camp
* It `represents_instance_of_type` Tree ("aat:300132410"), meaning there is a tree depicted but the tree has no separate identity beyond the content
* It was `created_by` a Creation which ...
  * ... was `carried_out_by` Miro
  * ... had a `timespan` of between "1921-01-01" and "1922-12-31"
