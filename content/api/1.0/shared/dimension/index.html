## Property Definitions

### Properties of Dimensions

| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `id`              | string        | Optional    | If present, the value MUST be a URI identifying the identifier, rather than the URI which is the identifier of the object |  
| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the name, which MUST be the value `"Dimension"` |
| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label, intended for developers |
| `value`           | number        | Required    | The numeric value of the dimension |
| `unit`            | json object   | Required    | The unit for the dimension, which MUST follow the requirements for a [MeasurementUnit](../type/) |
| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the dimension and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) |
| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a textual representation of the data structure, and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../name/) |
| `upper_value_limit` | number      | Optional    | A number, which represents the highest possible value for the dimension|
| `lower_value_limit` | number      | Optional    | A number, which represents the lowest possible value for the dimension |
| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is either a [reference](../reference/) to a [textual work](../../endpoint/textual_work/) that refers to the identifier, or an embedded [statement](../statement/) about the identifier. |
| `assigned_by`     | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a measurement activity for the dimension, as below |  

### Properties of Measurements

| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `id`              | string        | Optional    | If present, the value MUST be a URI identifying the measurement |  
| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the name, which MUST be the value `"AttributeAssignment"` |
| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the assignment, intended for developers |
| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the measurement and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) |
| `carried_out_by`  | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../reference/) to a [Person](../../endpoint/person) or [Group](../../endpoint/group) |
| `timespan`        | json object   | Optional    | A json object which MUST follow the requirements for [timespans](../timespan/)|
| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an embedded [statement](../statement/) about the measurement |


### Incoming Properties

Dimension instances are typically found as the object of the following properties.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases.

| Property Name   | Source Class      | Description |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `dimension`     | Non-Event classes | The dimension instance is a dimension of the source entity |
| `duration`      | TimeSpan          | The dimension is the length of time (duration) of the actual time span, within the boundaries described in the TimeSpan instance |

## Example

A Human-Made Object [instance](../../endpoint/physical_thing/) has a dimension of 24 (+/- 2) inches high, as measured by a curator:

* The dimension has a URI given as an identifier in `id`
* It has a `type` of "Dimension"
* It is `classified_as` a height, with `id` of _aat:300055644_, and a `type` of `Type`
* It has a `value` of 24, an `upper_value_limit` of 26, and a `lower_value_limit` of 22, for 24 plus or minus 2.
* It has a `unit` of inches, with `id` of _aat:300379100_ and a `type` of `MeasurementUnit`
* It is `identified_by` a Name, which is `classified_as` a display title, with an `id` of _aat:300404669_ and `type` of Type.  The Name has `content` of the string "24 inches high (+/- 2 inches)"
* It is `assigned_by` a measurement, which...
  * ... has a URI given in `id`
  * ... has a `type` of `AttributeAssignment`
  * ... is `classified_as` measuring, with `id` of _aat:300053578_ and a `type` of Type
  * ... is `carried_out_by` the curator, being a reference to an instance in a [person endpoint](../../endpoint/person/)

```crom
top = model.HumanMadeObject()
d = vocab.Height()
d.value = 24
d.unit = vocab.instances['inches']
d.lower_value_limit = 22
d.upper_value_limit = 26
aa = vocab.Measuring()
aa.carried_out_by = model.Person(label="Curator")
d.assigned_by = aa
d.identified_by =  vocab.DisplayName(content="24 inches high (+/- 2 inches)")
top.dimension = d
```
