## Introduction

Names are described in the [base patterns](/model/base/#types-and-classifications) of the model documentation, and examples are present for practically every class.

## Property Definitions

### Properties of Identifiers

| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `id`              | string        | Optional    | If present, the value MUST be a URI identifying the identifier, rather than the URI which is the identifier of the object |  
| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the name, which MUST be the value `"Identifier"` |
| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label, intended for developers |
| `content`         | string        | Required    | The string content of the identifier |
| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the identifier and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) |
| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is either a [reference](../reference/) to a [textual work](../../endpoint/textual_work/) that refers to the identifier, or an embedded [statement](../statement/) about the identifier. |
| `assigned_by`     | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an assignment of the identifier, as below |  


### Properties of Identifier Assignments

| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `id`              | string        | Optional    | If present, the value MUST be a URI identifying the assignment |  
| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the name, which MUST be the value `"AttributeAssignment"` |
| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the assignment, intended for developers |
| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the assignment and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) |
| `carried_out_by`  | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../reference/) to a [Person](../../endpoint/person) or [Group](../../endpoint/group) |
| `timespan`        | json object   | Optional    | A json object which MUST follow the requirements for [timespans](../timespan/)|
| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an embedded [statement](../statement/) about the assignment |


### Incoming Properties

Name instances are typically found as the object of the following properties, other than the self-referential ones covered above.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases.

| Property Name   | Source Class      | Description |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `identified_by` | All               | |
| `contact_point` | Person, Group     | |

## Example

An accession number for an object, created and assigned by Example Museum at some point during 1997.

```crom
top = model.HumanMadeObject()
id = vocab.AccessionNumber(label="Example Museum Accession Number", content="1997-A1752")
top.identified_by = id
id.referred_to_by = vocab.Note(content="This is the original accession number from 1997")
aa = model.AttributeAssignment(label="Assignment of 1997-A1752")
id.assigned_by = aa
aa.carried_out_by = model.Group(label="Example Museum")
ts = model.TimeSpan(label="1997")
aa.timespan = ts
ts.begin_of_the_begin = "1997-01-01T00:00:00Z"
ts.end_of_the_end = "1997-12-31T00:00:00Z"
```
