## Introduction


## Property Definitions

### Type / Concept

| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `id`              | string        | Required    | The value MUST be a URI identifying the concept |  
| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class of the place, which MUST be the value `"Type"` |
| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the place, intended for developers |
| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the Type and MUST follow these requirements for Type |


### Incoming Properties

Type instances are typically found as the object of the following properties:

| Property Name   | Source Class | Description |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `classified_as` | All          | Almost every entity can be classified as a Type |
| `technique`     | Activity     | Activities (of all sorts) can have a technique, which is modeled as a Type |
| `motivated_by`  | Activity     | Activities can also be motivated by a Type |
| `about`         | Textual Work, Visual Work | Textual and Visual Works can have subjects, which are modeled as Types |


## Example


```crom
top = vocab.Painting()
```


## Extended Definition

If a Type is created by the publishing institution rather than referring to a commonly used, existing vocabulary, then it is useful to provide an extended description of the Type at the URI given in `id`. This is not part of the Linked Art API, but is provided as a recommendation. 

When the URI of the Type is dereferenced as if it were an endpoint, then the following properties are also available in addition to those above.


| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is either a name of the Type and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the Type and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/) |
| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a human readable statement about the Type and MUST follow the requirements for [Statement](../../shared/statement/) |
| `part_of`         | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Type that the current Type is narrower than and MUST follow the requirements for an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to a Type |
| `member_of`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Set that the current Type is a member of and MUST follow the requirements for an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to a [Set](../../endpoint/set/) |
