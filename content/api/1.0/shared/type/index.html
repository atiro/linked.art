## Introduction

Concepts, called Types, are a core part of the model and present in practically every resource description. They give access to external vocabularies, such as the Getty's Art and Architecture Thesaurus, in order to add classifications to entities described. As they are external entities, rather than the focus of the Linked Art documentation, they are only slightly more detailed than any other [entity reference](../reference/), allowing an additional meta-classification to be asserted about the Type. 

Types are described in the [base patterns](/model/base/#types-and-classifications) of the model documentation, and examples are present for practically every class.

## Property Definitions

### Type / Concept

| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `id`              | string        | Required    | The value MUST be a URI identifying the concept |  
| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class of the concept, which MUST be the value `"Type"` |
| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the concept, intended for developers |
| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the Type and MUST follow these requirements for Type |


### Incoming Properties

Type instances are typically found as the object of the following properties.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases.

| Property Name   | Source Class | Description |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `classified_as` | All          | Almost every entity can be classified as a Type |
| `technique`     | `Activity`     | Activities (of all sorts) can have a technique, which is modeled as a Type |
| `motivated_by`  | `Activity`     | Activities can also be motivated by a Type |
| `about`         | `LinguisticObject`, `VisualItem` | Textual and Visual Works can have subjects, which are modeled as Types |
| `assigned`      | `AttributeAssignment` | The classification of an object might be assigned as part of a documented Attribute Assignment |


## Example

The concept "Painting" (_aat:300033618_) is a `Type`, has a label, and is classified as a Type of Work.

```crom
top = vocab.Painting()
```


## Extended Definition

If a Type is created by the publishing institution rather than referring to a commonly used, existing vocabulary, then it is useful to provide an extended description of the Type at the URI given in `id`. This is not part of the Linked Art API, but is provided as a recommendation. 

When the URI of the Type is dereferenced as if it were an endpoint, then the following properties are also available in addition to those above.


| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | 
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is either a name of the Type and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the Type and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/) |
| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a human readable statement about the Type and MUST follow the requirements for [Statement](../../shared/statement/) |
| `part_of`         | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Type that the current Type is narrower than and MUST follow the requirements for an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to a Type |
| `member_of`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Set that the current Type is a member of and MUST follow the requirements for an [entity reference](../../shared/reference/) to a [Set](../../endpoint/set/) |


### Extended Example

```crom
top = model.Type(label="GAN Art")
top.classified_as = vocab.instances['work type']
top.identified_by = vocab.LocalNumber(content="186_gan_art")
nm = vocab.PrimaryName(content="Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Generated Art")
nm.language = vocab.instances['english']
top.identified_by = nm
top.referred_to_by = vocab.Description(content="The generation of art by a process of training a machine learning algorithm to create the art, and a second algorithm to classify it, and then picking the higest classified image.")
top.part_of = model.Type(ident="http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300069478", label="Computer Art")
```
