## Summary

The V&A is proud to host the Linked Art community in a day long discussion of the use cases, benefits, challenges and details of using Linked Open Usable Data in an art museum environment. The topics of the conversation will range from basic "tombstone" data for the piece, through to its provenance, exhibitions and citations. We welcome anyone interested in these topics, and especially seek input from museums and cognate organizations looking for data solutions in these areas.
