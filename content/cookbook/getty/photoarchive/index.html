## Overview

### The Photograph

The Photograph in the archive does not have many properties in the data. Most are about the object depicted in the Photograph.

In particular:

 * `gcpa_acc_no`: the Getty Accession number
 * `photo_color`: whether the photograph is black and white, or color
 * `photo_collection`: the original photographer or collector's collection
 * `photo_source`: who the Getty acquired the photograph from
 * `photo_src_ref`: the source's reference number for the photograph

Other records also have:

 * `photo_date`: the date the photograph was taken
 * `photo_coll_ref`: the reference number in the original collection
 * `shelf_number`: the (older) shelf-based reference number the photograph
 * `acquisition_date`: the date the photograph was acquired
 * `photo_notes`: freetext notes about the photograph 

The mapping approach is:

 * The photograph itself is an [object](model/object)
 * The `gcpa_acc_no`, `photo_src_ref` and `photo_coll_ref` values are [identifiers](/model/object/identity), with collection specific contexts
 * The transaction between the `photo_source` and the Getty is modeled according to the [provenance](/model/provenance) model
 * The `photo_date` provides the timespan for the creation of the photograph (we do not distinguish between the act of photographing and printing of the physical photograph)
 * The `photo_notes` information is a note associated with the object, modeled in the same way as other [descriptive texts](/model/base/index.html#base_stmt).
 * The photograph then depicts the art object, as described under [depiction](/model/aboutness/#depiction)

This results in the model:

![Photograph Model](photo_model.png){: width="800px"}


### The Depicted Object

The rest of the information is about the object depicted.

 * The `artist*` fields, `national_school` and `date` provide the [creation information](/model/provenance/#object-creation) and information about the [artist](/model/actor/).
 * `name_title` is the [title](/model/object/identity/#titles) of the object
 * The `current*` fields, `reference_number` and `collection_type` are the last known location and owner of the object, described using the provenance model
 * `height`, `width` and `dimension_units` plus `media_materials` are the [physical characteristics](/model/object/physical/) of the object
 * `category` is object type, and `filing_category` is the [subject](/model/object/aboutness/#subject).
 * `excollections_provenance` is further known provenance information

## Mapping in Detail

### The Photograph

We create a `ManMadeObject` to represent the photograph, by checking the `photo_color` property to see whether it should be black and white _(aat:300128359)_, color _(aat:300128347)_ or if not present, then just a photograph _(aat:300046300)_.
We construct a label for the photograph based on this type and the name of the object depicted.

{{ macros.include_example("photo", resource.meta.eg) }}

We create an Identifier for the Accession Number, and type it as  _(aat:300312355)_. This is referenced from the photograph with the `identified_by` property.

{{ macros.include_example("accno", resource.meta.eg) }}

A second, more complex, Identifier for Anderson's identifier is created. This identifier is associated with the source collection, via a set of identifiers of which it is part.  We also create an Acquisition activity, by which the photograph is acquired by The Getty. This is not shown in the example below, but is shown in the full description of the photograph.

{{ macros.include_example("srcid", resource.meta.eg) }}

We create the original collection, despite only having a label for it, which will be referenced from the photograph via the `part_of` property.

{{ macros.include_example("pcoll", resource.meta.eg) }} 

Plus we link the, as of yet unconfigured, Painting resource to it via `depicts`.

{{ macros.include_example("photo_1", resource.meta.eg) }}

We can fill in the data to our model:

![Photograph Data following Model](photo_data.png){: width="800px"}


### The Art Object

We can fill out a lot of details about the object itself.  In particular, it has a Title (which we also associate with the object directly as a label), height and width dimensions in centimetres, and a parseable materials statement.  We record both the statement, as well as breaking the information out into machine readable material and part resources.

{{ macros.include_example("abase", resource.meta.eg) }}

Now we can tackle the production of the painting.  The activity is a `Production`, which was carried out by the artist at a particular point in time.  We know the artist's name and their birth and death dates.

{{ macros.include_example("aprod", resource.meta.eg) }}

And its current collection, owner and identifier:

{{ macros.include_example("aids", resource.meta.eg) }}

And its current location:

{{ macros.include_example("aloc", resource.meta.eg) }}

Full Art Object:

{{ macros.include_example("art", resource.meta.eg) }}
