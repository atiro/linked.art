## Introduction

A brief walk through of mapping a sample Photo Archive record from the Getty.

## Overview

### The Photograph

The Photograph in the archive does not have many properties in the data. Most are about the object depicted in the Photograph.

In particular:

 * `gcpa_acc_no`: the Getty Accession number
 * `photo_color`: whether the photograph is black and white, or color
 * `photo_collection`: the original photographer or collector's collection
 * `photo_source`: who the Getty acquired the photograph from
 * `photo_src_ref`: the source's reference number for the photograph

Other records also have:

 * `photo_date`: the date the photograph was taken
 * `photo_coll_ref`: the reference number in the original collection
 * `shelf_number`: the (older) shelf-based reference number the photograph
 * `acquisition_date`: the date the photograph was acquired
 * `photo_notes`: freetext notes about the photograph 

The mapping approach is:

 * The photograph itself is an [object](model/object)
 * The `gcpa_acc_no`, `photo_src_ref` and `photo_coll_ref` values are [identifiers](/model/object/identity), with collection specific contexts
 * The transaction between the `photo_source` and the Getty is modeled according to the [provenance](/model/provenance) model
 * The `photo_date` provides the timespan for the creation of the photograph (we do not distinguish between the act of photographing and printing of the physical photograph)
 * The `photo_notes` information is a note associated with the object
 * The photograph then depicts the art object, as described under [depiction](/model/aboutness/#depiction)


### The Depicted Object

The rest of the information is about the object depicted.

 * The `artist*` fields, `national_school` and `date` provide the [creation information](/model/provenance/#object-creation) and information about the [artist](/model/actor/).
 * `name_title` is the [title](/model/object/identity/#titles) of the object
 * The `current*` fields, `reference_number` and `collection_type` are the last known location and owner of the object, described using the provenance model
 * `height`, `width` and `dimension_units` plus `media_materials` are the [physical characteristics](/model/object/physical/) of the object
 * `category` is object type, and `filing_category` is the [subject](/model/object/aboutness/#subject).
 * `excollections_provenance` is further known provenance information
