## Introduction

It is very unlikely that the descriptions provided in this model are the only digital representations of the objects.  For building human readable representations, or just for linking to existing web pages, these other digital resources should be referenced.

## Image 

The most common scenario is if there are one or more images available of the object. This is described by using the `representation` property, which has an `Image` as its value. The `id` of the image is the URI at which it is available, and additional properties to describe the image should also be given, such as a `label` and its media type (sometimes called a MIME type) in `format`. 

{{ macros.include_example("objdig_image") }}

## Web Page

Another very common scenario is that there is a web page about the object, perhaps managed by a collections management system. For humans, this page is much more useful than the data intended for machines.  It can be referenced with the `homepage` property, and points to an `InformationObject` `classified_as` a web page, or _aat:300264578_.  As with digital images, the homepage should have a `format` of "text/html", the media type for HTML.

## IIIF 

[IIIF](http://iiif.io/), the International Image Interoperability Framework, is an increasingly common way to make images and descriptions intended to be displayed to humans available. There are two primary alignments with the CRM model, which mirror the above Image and Web Page patterns.

### IIIF Images

The [IIIF Image API](http://iiif.io/api/image/) in CRM can be considered an Image, even though it is a service for obtaining them, and can thus be referenced with the same `representation` property. In order to know that the URI is an Image API endpoint, it should not have a `format` and instead have a `conformsTo` property with the value "http://iiif.io/api/image".  This follows the `protocol` pattern in IIIF Image Information documents.

### IIIF Manifests 

The [IIIF Presentation API](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/) in CRM can be considered an Information Object that is about the object.  The property used to refer to it from the art object is `subject_of`.  It `conformsTo` the Presentation API URI, but can be given a `format` for JSON-LD that includes the context as a profile.
