# Core Identity Information

The core information that conveys the object's identity includes identifiers and titles/labels assigned to it, along with primary and more domain specific types.  

## Identifier

### URI

The URI of the resource, as given in `id`, is the primary identifier for the object, and the URI at which the description of the object is made available.

{{ macros.include_example("base_type") }}

### Non-URI / Legacy Identifiers

There are often other identifiers available for the object, including local numbers provided by a database or collection management system, accession numbers, or stock numbers.  These are recorded as separate objects, with a `value` and a type, and referenced from the object via the `identified_by` relationship.  This also allows them to be linked to the [documentation](/model/document/) that asserts the identifier.  The different types of identifier can be given via the `classified_as` property.

The example below expresses two legacy identifiers, an Accession Number _(aat:300312355)_ and a Local Number _(aat:300404621)_.
