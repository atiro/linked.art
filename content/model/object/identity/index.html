## Introduction

The core information that conveys the object's identity includes identifiers and titles/labels assigned to it, along with primary and more domain specific types.  

## Identifier

### URI

The URI of the resource, as given in `id`, is the primary identifier for the object, and the URI at which the description of the object is made available.

{{ macros.include_example("base_type") }}

### Non-URI / Legacy Identifiers

There are often other identifiers available for the object, including local numbers provided by a database or collection management system, accession numbers, or stock numbers.  These are recorded as separate resources, with a `value` and a type, and referenced from the object via the `identified_by` relationship.  This also allows them to be linked to the [documentation](/model/document/) that asserts the identifier.  The different types of identifier can be given via the `classified_as` property.

The example below expresses two legacy identifiers, an Accession Number _(aat:300312355)_ and a Local Number _(aat:300404621)_ provided by a database system.

### Context for Legacy Identifiers

Identifiers are typically assigned when an object is accessioned into a [collection](/model/collection/), or when technology systems that manage the descriptions of the objects, are updated.  It can be useful to associate the identifier with the collection it was minted for. This is done through an intermediary `InformationObject` which is the set of identifiers used in the collection. That set then `refers_to` the collection.

## Titles

Although the `label` of the resource should always be included, it is valuable to have more information about the title or titles of the work. Similarly to identifiers, titles are given their own resource with a type and `value`. It could, again like identifiers, also refer to the documentation where that title was assigned.  Unlike books, artworks often change titles or have many different versions assigned to them over time.

### Primary Title

The primary title should be given as the `label` of the object, and also as a `Title` resource with a `value` containing the same information.  The Primary title should be `classified_as` the preferred one via _aat:300404670_. There should be exactly one primary title given per language.

{{ macros.include_example("objid_title") }}

### Alternate Titles

Further titles may also be given in the same way, just without the classification as preferred.

{{ macros.include_example("objid_title_alt") }}

## Types

The primary type of the object, normally `ManMadeObject` is given in the `type` field.  More specific types are given using `classified_as`, referencing domain specific vocabularies.  For a set of commonly used specific types, please see the [vocabularies](/model/vocab/) section.
