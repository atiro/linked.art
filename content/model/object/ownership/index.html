## Introduction

Tracking the provenance of an object is described in detail in the [Provenance](/model/provenance) section of the model. This section describes how to link the object's description into those events and entities.

## Ownership

The current owner of the object should be referenced with `transferred_title_to` in the most recent `Acquisition` that `transferred_title_of` the object.  To make this easier to find from the object's description, the owner should also be referenced with `current_owner` from the object itself. There are further modeling details available about [People and Orgaizations](/model/actor) that might own objects.

__Example:__

The current owner of the painting is a Museum.

```crom
top = Painting(art=1)
top._label = "Painting"
who = MuseumOrg()
who._label = "Museum"
top.current_owner = who
```

## Location

The current location of the object is given using the `current_location` property.  This can give a reference to a gallery or specific part of a facility, or be used for the general address of the organization where the object is currently held. There are further modeling details available about [Places](/model/place/).


__Example:__

The current location of the painting is Gallery W6.

```crom
top = Painting(art=1)
top._label = "Painting"
where = Place()
where._label = "Gallery W6"
top.current_location = where
```
