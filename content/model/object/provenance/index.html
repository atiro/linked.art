## Introduction

Tracking the provenance of an object is described in detail in the [Provenance](/model/provenance) section of the model. This section describes how to link the object's description into those events and entities.

## Production

In the same way that the `Production` event can reference the object that it `produced`, the object can reference its `Production` with `produced_by`.

{{ macros.include_example("objprov_production") }}

## Ownership

The current owner of the object should be referenced as the value for `transferred_title_to` in the most recent `Acquisition` that `transferred_title_of` the object.  To make this easier to find from the object, the same Actor should also be referenced via `current_owner` from the object itself. The event in which the object was acquired, via the `acquired_title_through` property, can be included to let systems start to trace provenance events.
