## Introduction

The rights information about both the physical objects and their digital representations is important to capture.  For general, textual statements about rights information the model uses the LinguisticObject pattern that should be familiar.  For more specific rights that can be identified individually, such as copyright, and optionally who holds those rights, there is the ability to assert them in a machine readable way.

## Credit / Attribution Statement

It is important to be able to give a credit or attribution statement that should be displayed along with the object. For example, a painting that has been donated might have the requirement to state who the donor was. This is modeled as a `LinguisticObject`, that is `classified_as` _aat:300026687_ being the identity for "acknowledgements". The actual string is given in `value`.

## Rights Statement

For general statements about rights that have not been aligned with any other controlled vocabularies such as AAT or [rightsstatements.org](http://rightsstatements.org/), the information can be provided in the same way as for a credit line.  The difference is that it is `classified_as` _aat:300055547_, being the identity for general "legal concepts".

## Rights Assertions

More detailed information is, however, often available and it is useful to be explicit. These patterns associate a `Right` that the object is `subject_to`, and then give more detail about the nature of that right, such as what sort of right, and who holds it.
