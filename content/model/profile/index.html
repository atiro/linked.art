title: CIDOC-CRM Profile
---

## Introduction

With dozens of classes and hundreds of relationships, most of which are unnecessary, the CIDOC-CRM is a complex and unweildy ontology. The linked.art profile of CRM aims to pare that back to its excellent core that can be used to build practical and interoperable solutions to real world problems.

Combined with the easy-to-use JSON-LD serialization, this profile is a functional and robust baseline to cover 90% of the use cases of 90% of the organizations, with only 10% of the complexity of the full CRM ontology.

The documents below describe the analysis done. The profile itself is currently documented as the Linked Art Data Model.
