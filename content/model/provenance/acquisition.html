## Introduction

The majority of recorded provenance events are when the object changes ownership, and the various methods in which that happens.  In the descriptions below the terms 'seller' and 'buyer' are used to refer to the actor that is relinquishing ownership and the actor that is gaining ownership, even if there is no money or other goods or services changing hands. This is for clarity and conciseness of the descriptions, and not to imply that every transaction is a purchase.

## Object Acquisition

Acquisitions are used to describe the transfer of ownership of an object from one owner to the next. The first owner is typically the artist, who would then transfer it to the second owner, to the third owner and so on. The ownership chain can be expressed by repeating this same pattern with the buyer from one acquisition being the seller in the subsequent one.  It the previous owner (e.g. the seller if there is a value exchange) or the subsequent owner (e.g. the buyer) is not known for a particular acquisition, then the reference can be left out from the description.  
  
The model encodes this information with an `Acquisition` part of the overall Provenance Event. The acquisition is the transfer of the right of ownership of an object (referenced in `transferred_title_of`) from the seller (in `transferred_title_from`) to the buyer (in `transferred_title_to`). 

```crom
top = vocab.Procurement(label="Purchase of Sculpture")
buyer = Person(label="Buyer")
seller = Person(label="Seller")
acq = Acquisition(label="Acquisition of Sculpture from Seller")
top.part = acq
what = Sculpture(label="Sculpture", art=1)
acq.transferred_title_of = what
acq.transferred_title_from = seller
acq.transferred_title_to = buyer
```

### Agents

In some cases, it is known that an agent other than the buyer carried out the acquisition. This can be modeled by associating a different actor from the buyer (the person who title is transferred to) carrying out the activity. 

```crom
top = vocab.Procurement(label="Purchase of Sculpture")
buyer = Person(label="Buyer")
seller = Person(label="Seller")
agent = Person(label="Agent for the Buyer")
acq = Acquisition(label="Acquisition of Sculpture from Seller")
top.part = acq
what = Sculpture(label="Sculpture", art=1)
acq.transferred_title_of = what
acq.transferred_title_from = seller
acq.transferred_title_to = buyer
acq.carried_out_by = agent
```



## Payments

A purchase is a common type of acquisition in which money is exchanged for the object.  The provenance event consists of the acquisition along with one or more related payments.  This typically involves a payment from the seller to the buyer for the agreed upon price, but might include further payments to or from others such as for shared ownership, payment of debts owed, or for services rendered as part of the overall activity.

The `Payment` activity has equivalent relationships for the actor that the money is transferred from (`paid_from`), the actor the money is transferred to (`paid_to`), and the amount of money paid (`paid_amount`).  The amount itself is a `MonetaryAmount` that has a value (`value`) and a currency (`currency`).  

!!! note "Diachronic Comparison of Monetary Amounts"
    The CIDOC-CRM SIG have clarified that the `MonetaryAmount` refers to the face value of the combination of value and currency. This means that any comparison between `MonetaryAmount` instances should also take into account the datetimes of resources that reference it, rather than standing alone. Further, it is still unclear if the same `MonetaryAmount` can be used for all occurences of value and currency, or whether there is something more unique than that.

```crom
top = vocab.Procurement(label="Purchase of Sculpture")
seller = Actor(label="Seller")
buyer = Actor(label="Buyer")
paymt = Payment()
paymt.paid_from = buyer
paymt.paid_to = seller
amt = MonetaryAmount()
amt.value = 1000
amt.currency = vocab.instances['us dollars']
paymt.paid_amount = amt
top.part = paymt
```

### Multiple Owners

In some circumstances, the same object can be owned by multiple parties at the same time.  For example, art dealers will pool resources in order to purchase an expensive object and later share the proceeds of sale amongst themselves, or informal groups of individuals contributing to a purchase, where there isn't a legal entity that becomes the sole owner.

In these cases, there are simply multiple buyers or sellers for the `Purchase`. The object is owned by all of the individuals, and it is unknown as to whether the ownership is evenly distributed or not. Similarly the multiple actors working together might make a payment for the object, and it is unknown how much each actor contributed to the total.  It does not imply that each actor made the payment, that would be described as two separate `Payment` activities, one from each.

For situations where the division of ownership is known (likely based on the division of payment), please [see the section on legal claims of rights](legalclaims.html).

```crom
top = Purchase()
top._label = "Purchase of the Example Painting by two Art Dealers"
seller = Actor()
seller._label = "Seller"
what = Painting(art=1)
what._label = "Example Painting"
d1 = Group()
d1._label = "Art Dealership 1"
d2 = Group()
d2._label = "Art Dealership 2"
top.transferred_title_of = what
top.transferred_title_from = seller
top.transferred_title_to = d1
top.transferred_title_to = d2
paymt = Payment()
paymt.paid_from = d1
paymt.paid_from = d2
paymt.paid_to = seller
amt = MonetaryAmount()
amt.value = 1000
curr = Currency()
curr._label = "dollars"
amt.currency = curr
paymt.paid_amount = amt
top.part = paymt
```

### Agents and Commissions


### Auctions

The individual purchase that is the result of auctioning an object is the same as the above model.  The auction event itself however is important for understanding the provenance of the object, and is described in [more detail here](auctions.html). 


## Transfer of Custody

The model makes a distinction between the transfer of legal ownership (e.g. by sale or gift) and the transfer of custody (e.g. by losing the object or loaning it out for an exhibition). If the possession of the object is temporary, such that the object would be given back to the real owner at the end of that possession without what might be considered a sale or exchange, then it is a transfer of custody only.

Transfers of custody use a different class, `TransferOfCustody` instead of `Acquisition`. The properties that capture the parties and object involved are also different, although equivalent, to those of `Acquisition`: `transferred_custody_of` the object, `transferred_custody_from` the previous custodian, and `transferred_custody_to` the new custodian.

### Exhibitions

Exhibitions are a common way that the custody of an object changes, while the ownership remains the same.  Exhibitions are described in more detail [here](/model/exhibition/).

### Loss

The loss of an object is the transfer of custody away from its current owner, without stating a recipient.  In the future, if the object is discovered, the recipient might be able to be filled in.  If the object is then returned to the owner, there would be the reverse transfer of custody from the party that found it.  It might be that the owner simply loses track of it, and although it is still in their possession, they are not aware of it ... it has no custodian.

```crom
top = TransferOfCustody()
what = Painting(art=1)
what._label = "Example Lost Painting"
top.transferred_custody_of = what
who = Person()
who._label = "Previous Owner"
top.transferred_custody_from = who
when = TimeSpan()
when._label = "Time noticed as Lost"
when.begin_of_the_begin = "1790-12-04T00:00:00Z"
when.end_of_the_end = "1790-12-05T00:00:00Z"
top.timespan = when
```

### Theft

Theft, looting and other illegal acquisitions are covered more accurately under the [legal claims](legalclaims.html) pattern.  While CIDOC-CRM recommends the use of a Transfer of Custody as legal ownership does not change, there are serious drawbacks to this approach.  Notably when a stolen item is sold to an unwitting buyer, there is no outward appearance that there is anything untoward.  The ability to classify a legal claim as valid or invalid resolves this issue.
