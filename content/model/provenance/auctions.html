## Introduction

Auctions are a very common way for art objects to change ownership.  The description of the auction itself is valuable for historical context and to provide a sense of the changing value of the object.

## Auction

An auction (_aat:300054751_) is an activity which is performed by an organization (the auction house organization, _aat:300417515_), and for art objects typically takes place at the premises (_aat:300005234_) of the auction house.  It typically consists of many sets of objects, called Lots described below, being sold in separate sales to the highest bidder for each. The Auction description contains the information about the overall event (who, where, when) and is referenced by the sub-events in which the sales of the lots take place via `part_of`.

```crom
top = vocab.AuctionEvent(label="Example Auction in London 1875-03-12,13")
org = vocab.AuctionHouseOrg(label="Auction House")
where = vocab.AuctionHouse(label="Auction House Premises, London")
top.took_place_at = where
top.carried_out_by = org
t = TimeSpan()
t._label = "12th and 13th of March, 1875"
t.begin_of_the_begin = "1875-03-12T00:00:00Z"
t.end_of_the_end = "1875-03-14T00:00:00Z"
top.timespan = t
```

## Sale of Lot

The sale of the Lot is an activity that can be carried out by one or more Auctioneers (_aat:300025208_), though if the individual is not known, the company that performs the parent Auction can be inferred. The sale is for a specific object of the Lot, which is always a collection even if there is only one object being sold. The activity is further subdivided into two major sections -- the activity of the crowd of bidding, and the purchase of the Lot by the winner.  Typically the details of individual bids are not known, but often whether any bids occured or not is known.  Bidding without a purchase might occur if the reserve price was not met, for example.

```crom
top = vocab.Auction(label="Auction of Lot J-1823-5")
top.carried_out_by = vocab.Auctioneer(label="Example Auctioneer")
top.used_specific_object = vocab.AuctionLotSet(label="Set of Objects for Lot J-1823-5")
top.part = vocab.Bidding(label="Bids on Lot J-1823-5")
top.caused = vocab.ProvenanceEntry("Sale of Lot J-1823-5")
```

## Set of Objects 

The Lot is a set of objects (_aat:300411307_) grouped together for the purposes of the sale, and may have come from different owners.  Information that is frequently known about the lot includes an identifying Lot Number (_aat:300404628_) assigned by the organization performing the auction and the objects that are part of it.  Other Lot specific information includes prices, which are discussed in further detail below.

```crom
top = vocab.AuctionLotSet(label="Set of Objects for Lot 812")
top.identified_by = LotNumber(content="812")
top.member = Painting(label="Example Painting", art=1)
```

## Purchase

The purchase of the lot is very similar to the purchase of any other object, however in order to ensure consistency, the individual transfers of ownership are explicitly stated as further child activities. As the lot is just the grouping of the objects together for the purposes of the auction, it doesn't make sense to transfer ownership of it, as the grouping is only for the purpose of the auction.

Conversely, there is only a single payment for the entire lot.  Thus while there might be multiple Acquisitions as part of the Provenance Entry, there is likely to be only a single Payment.

```crom
top = vocab.ProvenanceEntry(label="Purchase via Lot 812")
top.used_specific_object = vocab.AuctionLotSet(label="Set of Objects for Lot 812")
seller = Person(label="Seller")
buyer = Person(label="Buyer")
acq = Acquisition(label="Acquisition of Painting via Lot 812")
top.part = acq
acq.transferred_title_of = Painting(label="Example Painting", art=1)
acq.transferred_title_from = seller
acq.transferred_title_to = buyer
pay = Payment(label="Payment for Lot 812")
ma = MonetaryAmount(value=4500)
ma.currency = vocab.instances['us dollars']
pay.paid_amount = ma
pay.paid_from = buyer
pay.paid_to = seller
top.part = pay
```

## Monetary Values

In Auctions, there are several types of monetary values that are useful and interesting to record.  There is a significant distinction, however, between the starting price or reserve price for an auction and the regular purchase price of an object, in that even if the auction never takes place, these other prices are still known as they are set in advance.

### Pre-set Prices

There are three preset prices of interest:

  * __Starting Price:__  (_aat:300417242_) The price at which the auction will start.
  * __Reserve Price:__  (_aat:300417243_) The price that must be exceeded for the auction to result in a sale.
  * __Estimated Price:__  (_aat:300417244_) The price that the auction house estimates will be the final sale price.

These prices are associated with the Set of Objects that the Lot is intended to sell.  In this way, even if the auction never takes place, there is still the set of objects to associate the prices with.  In order to associate a monetary value with an object, it is treated as an observed dimension.

__Example:__

A lot with a starting price of $500, a reserve price of $3000 and an estimated price of $4000:

```crom
top = AuctionLotSet(label = "Set of Objects for Lot 812")
top.identified_by = LotNumber(content = "812")
top.member = Painting(label = "Example Painting")
amnt = vocab.StartingPrice(value = 500)
amnt.currency = vocab.instances['us dollars']
amnt2 = vocab.EstimatedPrice(value=4000)
amnt2.currency = vocab.instances['us dollars']
amnt3 = vocab.ReservePrice(value = 3000)
amnt3.currency = vocab.instances['us dollars']
top.dimension = amnt
top.dimension = amnt2
top.dimension = amnt3
```


### Known Bid Amounts

Sometimes we also know the monetary amounts that were unsuccessfully bid for the object, regardless of whether the auction eventually ended in a sale or not.  These bids are part of the overall bidding activity.

Bids are modeled as the creation of a proposition that the bidder (or the person that an agent is bidding on behalf of) will pay a certain amount of money for the object. In the example below, a known bid is $10,000 but it is not stated whether there was a sale concluded.


```crom
top = Activity()
top._label = "Auction of Lot J-1823-5"
who = Auctioneer()
who._label = "Example Auctioneer"
top.carried_out_by = who
lotset = AuctionLotSet()
lotset._label = "Set of Objects for Lot J-1823-5"
top.used_specific_object = lotset
bidset = Activity()
bidset._label = "Bids made on Lot"
top.part = bidset
bid = vocab.Bidding()
bidset.part = bid
who = Person()
who._label = "Example Bidder"
bid.carried_out_by = who
bidprop = PropositionalObject()
bid.created = bidprop
amnt = MonetaryAmount()
amnt.value = 10000
curr = Currency()
curr._label = "dollars"
amnt.currency = curr
bidprop.refers_to = amnt
```



## Auction Catalog

Much of the information we have about historical auctions comes from Auction Catalogs _(aat:300026068)_.  These documents thus provide the primary source of evidence, and can be linked to the descriptions of the activities.  These follow the same model as other [documents](/model/document/) with the added AAT concept for being an auction catalog.

```crom
top = AuctionCatalogText()
top._label = "Auction Catalog of Example Auction"
entry = LinguisticObject()
entry._label = "Description of Lot 16"
top.part = entry
auc = Auction()
auc._label = "Example Auction, 1924"
top.refers_to = auc
lot = Activity()
lot._label = "Auction of Lot 16"
entry.refers_to = lot
lotset = AuctionLotSet()
lotset._label = "Lot 16"
entry.refers_to = lotset
```
