## Introduction

Auctions are a very common way for objects to change ownership.  The description of the auction itself is valuable for historical context and to provide a sense of the changing value of the object.

## Auction

An auction (_aat:300054751_) is an activity which is performed by an organization, and for art objects typically takes place at an auction house (_aat:300005234_).  It consists of many `Lot`s, which are the individual activities where the auctioneer auctions off a particular object or set of objects.  That activity further consists of bidding and, if successful, is finished by a transaction where the winner of the lot pays for and takes ownership of their newly acquired object(s).

## Lot

Mostly not known, but sometimes we do have more details, particularly the high bid that did not meet the reserve.
Also, it could be important to distinguish that there was bidding, versus an auction that occured with no bids.
