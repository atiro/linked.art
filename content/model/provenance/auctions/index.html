## Introduction

Auctions are a very common way for objects to change ownership.  The description of the auction itself is valuable for historical context and to provide a sense of the changing value of the object.

## Auction

The `Auction` is an activity which is performed by an organization, typically at an auction house.  It consists of many `Lot`s, which are the individual activities where the auctioneer auctions off a particular object or set of objects.  That activity further consists of bidding and, if successful, is finished by a transaction where the winner of the lot pays for and takes ownership of their newly acquired object(s).
