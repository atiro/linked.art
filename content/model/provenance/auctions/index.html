## Introduction

Auctions are a very common way for art objects to change ownership.  The description of the auction itself is valuable for historical context and to provide a sense of the changing value of the object.

## Auction

An auction (_aat:300054751_) is an activity which is performed by an organization, and for art objects typically takes place at an auction house (_aat:300005234_).  It (typically) consists of many sets of objects being sold in separate sales to the highest bidder, called Lots described below. The Auction description contains the information about the overall event (who, where, when) and references the sub-events in which the sales of the lots take place via `consists_of`.

## Sale of Lot

The sale of the Lot is an activity that can be carried out by one or more Auctioneers (_aat:300025208_), though if the individual is not known, the company that performs the parent Auction can be inferred. The sale is for a specific object of the Lot, which is always a collection even if there is only one object being sold. The activity is further subdivided into two major sections -- the activity of the crowd of bidding, and the purchase of the Lot by the winner.  Typically the details of individual bids are not known, but often whether any bids occured or not is known.  Bidding without a Purchase might occur if the reserve price was not met, for example.

## Set of Objects 

The Lot is a set of objects (_aat:300411307_) grouped together for the purposes of the sale, and may have come from different owners.  Information that is frequently known about the lot includes an identifying Lot Number (_aat:300404628_) assigned by the organization performing the auction and the objects that are part of it.  Other Lot specific information includes prices, which are discussed in further detail below.

## Purchase

The purchase of the lot is very similar to the purchase of any other object, however in order to ensure consistency, the individual transfers of ownership are explicitly stated as further child activities. As the Lot is just the grouping of the objects together for the purposes of the auction, it doesn't make sense to transfer ownership of it, as the grouping is only for the purpose of the auction.

There is typically a single price for the lot, rather than each object having an individual value, and as such the Payment is associated with the purchase of the Lot resource.  Thus, if the interest is calculating the value of the individual objects over time, the number of objects in the Lot should be taken into account.  This information might be duplicated on the purchase of the object, which should take precedence.

## Monetary Values

In Auctions, there are several types of monetary values that are useful and interesting to record.  There is a significant distinction, however, between the starting price or reserve price for an auction and the regular purchase price of an object, in that even if the auction never takes place, these other prices are still known as they are set in advance.

### Pre-set Prices

There are three preset prices of interest:

  * __Starting Price:__  The price at which the auction will start.
  * __Reserve Price:__  The price that must be exceeded for the auction to result in a sale.
  * __Estimated Price:__  The price that the auction house estimates will be the final sale price.

These prices are associated with the Set of Objects that the Lot is intended to sell.  In this way, even if the auction never takes place, there is still the set of objects to associate the prices with.  In order to associate a monetary value with an object, it is treated as an observed dimension.

## Auction Catalog

Much of the information we have about historical auctions comes from Auction Catalogs.  These documents thus provide the primary source of evidence, and can be linked to the descriptions of the activities.
