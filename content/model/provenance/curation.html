## Introduction

While owned, the object is typically looked after and activities take place that affect it or try to preserve it. Whether these activities can be formally considered 'curation' is a very subjective and potentially controversial opinion, and we make no distinction between individual owners, art dealers, museums and galleries, or any other party that takes actions while owning an object. 


#### Taking Inventory

One such activity is taking inventory _(aat:300077506)_ by the owner of all their objects, including the one being described. This is routinely carried out by art dealers, collectors or museums, in order to ensure that they still have custody of all of the objects that they believe they do.  This establishes the existence and presence of the object at a certain place and time, and is thus useful in tracking the object through history.

top = vocab.ProvenanceEntry(ident="auto int-per-segment")
inv = vocab.Inventorying()
top.part = inv
```
