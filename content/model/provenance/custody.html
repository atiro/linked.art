## Introduction

The majority of recorded provenance events are when the object changes ownership, and the various methods in which that happens.


## Transfer of Custody

The model makes a distinction between the transfer of legal ownership (e.g. by sale or gift) and the transfer of custody (e.g. by losing the object or loaning it out for an exhibition). If the possession of the object is temporary, such that the object would be given back to the real owner at the end of that possession without what might be considered a sale or exchange, then it is a transfer of custody only.

Transfers of custody use a different class, `TransferOfCustody` instead of `Acquisition`. The properties that capture the parties and object involved are also different, although equivalent, to those of `Acquisition`: `transferred_custody_of` the object, `transferred_custody_from` the previous custodian, and `transferred_custody_to` the new custodian.

### Exhibitions

Exhibitions are a common way that the custody of an object changes, while the ownership remains the same.  Exhibitions are described in more detail [here](/model/exhibition/).

### Loss

The loss of an object is the transfer of custody away from its current owner, without stating a recipient.  In the future, if the object is discovered, the recipient might be able to be filled in.  If the object is then returned to the owner, there would be the reverse transfer of custody from the party that found it.  It might be that the owner simply loses track of it, and although it is still in their possession, they are not aware of it ... it has no custodian.

```crom
top = TransferOfCustody()
what = Painting(art=1)
what._label = "Example Lost Painting"
top.transferred_custody_of = what
who = Person()
who._label = "Previous Owner"
top.transferred_custody_from = who
when = TimeSpan()
when._label = "Time noticed as Lost"
when.begin_of_the_begin = "1790-12-04T00:00:00Z"
when.end_of_the_end = "1790-12-05T00:00:00Z"
top.timespan = when
```

### Theft

Theft, looting and other illegal acquisitions are covered more accurately under the [legal claims](legalclaims.html) pattern.  While CIDOC-CRM recommends the use of a Transfer of Custody as legal ownership does not change, there are serious drawbacks to this approach.  Notably when a stolen item is sold to an unwitting buyer, there is no outward appearance that there is anything untoward.  The ability to classify a legal claim as valid or invalid resolves this issue.
