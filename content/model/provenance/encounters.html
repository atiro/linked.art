## Introduction

Objects can be encountered a long time after their production, especially in the realm of archaeology. These encounters are often called "finds" and the locations they take place at "find spots", but the object may have been never lost according to another culture that always knew about it. Encounters are frequently of objects from a long-vanished civilization, such as the Greek or Roman empires, but not necessarily. The object might be buried under the ash of a volcanic eruption, lost at sea, or otherwise pass out of human memory and record as far as the documenting institution is aware.

There might be multiple encounters recorded in a provenance chain, such as when an object is known to have been encountered and subsequently lost by a previous culture, and then rediscovered.

```crom
top = vocab.ProvenanceEntry()
what = vocab.Sculpture(label="Lost Sculpture")
who = model.Person(label="Fisherman")
where = model.Place(label="At Sea")
enc = model.Encounter(label="Encounter of Sculpture")
enc.encountered = what
enc.carried_out_by = who
enc.took_place_at = where
top.part =  enc
acq = model.Acquisition()
acq.transferred_title_of = what
acq.transferred_title_to = who
top.part = acq
```
