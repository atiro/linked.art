## Introduction

This section covers the beginning and ending of objects' existence, along with the attribution of the artist to the production of the object.

## Object Creation

The first activity in an object's provenance or lifecycle is its creation, or `Production`.  The relationship to the object that was produced by the activity (`produced`) is added to the general activity model, along with the time, location and actors.

```crom
top = Production()
who = Actor()
who.label = "Example Artist"
what = Painting(art=1)
what.label = "Example Painting"
when = TimeSpan()
where = Place()
where.label = "Example Artist's Studio"
when.begin_of_the_begin = "1780-03-05T00:00:00Z"
when.end_of_the_end = "1780-03-06T00:00:00Z"
top.carried_out_by = who
top.timespan = when
top.produced = what
top.took_place_at = where
```

### Inspiration or Copies

Some artworks are copies of, or clearly directly inspired by, others.  This relationship with another work can be captured with the `influenced_by` property of the `Production` activity. The copy could be from memory or with the copied object physically present, and it could be a faithful reproduction or merely recognizably similar. 

```crom
top = Production()
what = Painting(art=1)
what.label = "Copy of Example Painting"
copied = Painting(art=1)
copied.label = "Example Painting"
top.influenced_by = copied
top.produced = what
who = Person()
who.label = "Copyist"
top.carried_out_by = who
```

### Reproduction from an Identifiable Source

Many objects are created from a source, such as a photograph being printed from a negative, a print created from a woodcut, or a sculpture made from a cast.  The use of the particular source can be captured as part of the description of the `Production` of the object using the `used_specific_object` property.

All of the art objects created from the same source show the same image, be it flat or three dimensional. The source also shows the same image, albiet likely somehow reversed. The image is modeled as a `VisualItem` that all of the physical objects, including the source object, show. This allows us to group the objects together based on their provenance.

```crom
top = Production()
top.label = "Printing of Photograph"
what = Photograph()
what.label = "Photograph"
negative = Negative()
negative.label = "Negative"
top.used_specific_object = negative
vi = VisualItem()
vi.label = "Visual Content of Photographs and Negative"
what.shows = vi
negative.shows = vi
```

### Techniques

If there is a particular technique known to have been used in the creation of the object, for example glassblowing identified by _aat:300053932_, the identifier for the technique can be included as the `technique` of the activity.

```crom
top = Production()
who = Actor()
who.label = "Example Glassblower"
what = Sculpture(art=1)
what.label = "Glass Sculpture"
top.carried_out_by = who
top.technique = instances['glassblowing']
```

### Multiple Artists with Roles

If there are multiple artists collaborating, and they had individual roles or their work took place at different locations or over different time periods, then we follow the pattern of creating components of the main `Production` activity.  Each of the components captures the details of one particular artist's role in the production of the object. For example, a sculpture that is painted by another artist, would be produced by the overall activity, with two components one for each artist's role.

```crom
top = Production()
what = Sculpture(art=1)
what.label = "Painted Sculpture"
top.produced = what
act1 = Production()
act1.technique = instances['sculpting']
who = Actor()
who.label = "Example Sculptor"
act1.carried_out_by = who
top.part = act1
act2 = Production()
who2 = Actor()
who2.label = "Example Sculpture Painter"
act2.technique = instances['painting']
act2.carried_out_by = who2
top.part = act2
```

### Attribution of a Group

Even if the artist's or artists' identity is not known exactly, the person or persons may be known to have been part of a group, such as the workshop of a more famous "master". In this case, the `Group` that represents the workshop can be the actor that carries out the `Production`.  The "master" of the workshop is represented as the Actor that carried out the `Formation` of the `Group`.  

```crom
top = Production()
what = Painting(art=1)
what.label = "Example Painting, from workshop of Example Master"
top.produced = what
grp = Group()
grp.label = "Workshop of Example Master"
f = Formation()
who = Person()
who.label = "Example Master"
f.carried_out_by = who
grp.formed_by = f
top.carried_out_by = grp
```

### Previous or Uncertain Attributions

Over time, attributions can be contested and change. The actor that is listed in `carried_out_by` from the `Production` should always be the one currently believed to have produced the art work.  Previous attributions, or ones that are so uncertain that there is a concern about using `carried_out_by` at all, can be recorded using the `AttributeAssignment` pattern, further described [here](/model/assertion/).

```crom
top = AttributeAssignment()
obj = Painting(art=1)
obj.label = "Example Painting"
who = Person()
who.label = "Previously-Thought Artist"
prod = Production()
prod.carried_out_by = who
top.assigned = prod
top.assigned_to = obj
top.classified_as = "produced_by"
by = Person()
by.label = "Painting Curator"
top.carried_out_by = by
ts = TimeSpan()
ts.begin_of_the_begin = "1923-07-20"
ts.end_of_the_end = "1923-07-21"
top.timespan = ts
```

## Destruction

The end of the provenance chain of an object is when it is known to have been destroyed.  Loss of the object leaves the chain open ended as it might be recovered in the future, however if the object is destroyed then there is no coming back. Objects should, thus, only be recorded as destroyed if they are known to be so.

Objects are destroyed by events that are not carried out by an actor are modeled with the `EndOfExistence` class. However if the destruction is carried out by some actor, then it is also an `Activity` at the same time. This extra class must be added explicitly, and is a different model from `Production` which is always an `Activity`.

```crom
top = Destruction()
what = Painting(art=1)
what.label = "Example Destroyed Painting"
top.destroyed = what
when = TimeSpan()
when.begin_of_the_begin = "1823-03-01T00:00:00Z"
when.end_of_the_end = "1823-03-31T00:00:00Z"
top.timespan = when
#who = Person()
#who.label = "Painting Destroyer"
#top.carried_out_by = who
```
