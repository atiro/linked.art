<rdfs:Class rdf:about="E92_Spacetime_Volume">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Spacetime Volume</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises 4 dimensional point sets (volumes) in physical spacetime regardless its true geometric form. They may derive their identity from being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the interpretation of an expression defining an extent in spacetime. 
	Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, Place and Timespan are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume.  An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. 
	Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of a spacetime volume is trivially its projection on time.
