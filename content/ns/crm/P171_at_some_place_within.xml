    <rdfs:comment>This property describes the maximum spatial extent within which an E53 Place falls. Since instances of E53 Places may not have precisely known spatial extents, the CRM supports statements about maximum spatial extents of E53 Places . This property allows an instance of an E53 Places&#8217;s maximum spatial extent (i.e. its outer boundary) to be assigned an E94 Space Primitive value. P171 at some place within is a shortcut of the fully developed path E53 Place, P89 falls within, E53 Place, P168 place is defined by, E94 Space Primitive through a not represented declarative Place as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013) to a Space Primitive.</rdfs:comment>
