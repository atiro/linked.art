<rdf:Property rdf:about="P174_starts_before_the_end_of">
    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">starts before the end of</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>This property specifies that the temporal extent of the domain instance A of E2 Temporal Entity starts definitely before the end of the temporal extent of the range instance B of E2 Temporal Entity. In other words, if A = [Astart, Aend] and B = [Bstart, Bend], we mean Astart &lt; Bend is true. This property is part of the set of temporal primitives P173 &#8211; P176, P182 &#8211; P185. This property corresponds to a disjunction (logical OR) of the following Allen temporal relations [Allen, 1983] :{before, meets, overlaps, starts, started-by, contains, finishes, finished-by, equals, during, overlapped by} Typically, this property is a consequence of a known influence of some event on another event or activity, such as a novel written by someone being continued by someone else, or the knowledge of a defeat on a distant battlefield causing people to end their ongoing activities</rdfs:comment>
