This property identifies the E39 Actor or Actors who have or have had custody of an instance of E18 Physical Thing at
some time. This property leaves open the question if parts of this physical thing have
been added or removed during the time-spans it has been under the custody of this
actor, but it is required that at least a part which can unambiguously be identified as
representing the whole has been under this custody for its whole time. The way, in
which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps
a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept
instance of E18 Physical Thing.
The distinction with P50 has current keeper (is current keeper of) is that P49 has former or current
keeper (is former or current keeper of) leaves open the question as to whether the specified keepers are
current.
P49 has former or current keeper (is former or current keeper of) is a shortcut for the more detailed
path from E18 Physical Thing through P30 transferred custody of (custody transferred through), E10
Transfer of Custody, P28 custody surrendered by (surrendered custody through) or P29 custody
received by (received custody through) to E39 Actor.
