While the Linked Art community is still growing, our meetings are relatively small and generally aim to move the work forward, rather than as broad engagement and dissemination events. 

All interactions in the Linked Art community, in person or online, are covered by our [Code of Conduct](/community/conduct/). This code of conduct borrows extensively from existing community codes of conduct and norms.
