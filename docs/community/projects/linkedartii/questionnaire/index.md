title: "Linked Art II: Questionnaire"
---

[TOC]


[Linked Art](https://linked.art) is a new data standard being developed to describe artworks and facilitate connections between cultural heritage collections, thereby creating new opportunities for digital discovery and research using this interlinked data.
 
The ‘Linked Art II’ project at the University of Oxford invites you to participate in our questionnaire to share your views on the use and adoption of Linked Art, including any opportunities and challenges you can foresee. We are interested in receiving feedback from all those who create, support, or do research using art collections data.
 
The questionnaire will close at midnight AOE (anywhere on earth) on 13 June 2022.
 
An information sheet about the questionnaire can be found below, which is also copied within the questionnaire.
 
Please follow this link to participate in the survey: 
[https://oxford.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/linked-art-ii](https://oxford.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/linked-art-ii)
 
As part of the questionnaire you will be given the opportunity to try out some ‘code notebooks’ which help illustrate the technical steps involved in transforming, reconciling, and visualising Linked Art data. [This follows the online webinar demonstrating the code notebooks we held on 3 May 2022](../webinar/index.md).
 
We seek your feedback no matter the level of your existing familiarity with Linked Art and the
technologies and standards it uses. Should you wish to know more about Linked Art and
Linked Data, we have prepared a page linking to background videos and summaries we
hope you will find helpful and informative. We will link to sections of this page through the
questionnaire, however you may wish to bookmark it now: [https://linked.art/community/projects/linkedartii/questionnaire/resources/](https://linked.art/community/projects/linkedartii/questionnaire/resources/)
 
The interactive notebooks in Section 2 step through some technical implementation details
of Linked Art using JSON-LD and Jupyter notebooks. Our resources page also provides
background on these technologies, should you be unfamiliar with them but would like to give
the notebooks a try.
 
# Questionnaire Information (also copied in the questionnaire)

The aim of this study is to understand your views on the use and adoption of Linked Art, particularly and opportunities and challenges you might identify.

We appreciate your interest in participating in this questionnaire. You have been invited to participate because you are over 18 years old. Please read through this information before agreeing to participate (if you wish to) by selecting ‘Yes’ to the relevant question below. You may ask any questions before deciding to take part by contacting the researcher (details below).

The Principal Researcher is Tanya Gray, who is part of the Digital Scholarship at Oxford the Humanities Division at the University of Oxford. This project is being completed under the supervision of Principal Investigator Dr Kevin Page from the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford.

In the questionnaire:

1.  You will be asked questions relating to Linked Art and its application in creating connections across Cultural Heritage collections data.
2.  Optionally, you will be able to explore interactive code notebooks which create Linked Art data. You will be invited to  give feedback on the notebooks, and the use of code notebooks as a training resource.
3.  You will be invited to suggest ideas for future uses of Linked Art. We will ask whether you wish to collaborate with the project to realise these ideas, and if so, whether you have data to share and the authority to do so.

This should take about 20-30 minutes for the core questionnaire. Choosing to watch the introduction videos and/or explore more than one of our code notebooks will take longer. No background knowledge is required.

Researchers will review the completed questionnaires to inform future research priorities for the Linked Art II project at the University of Oxford, and as the basis for reporting trends to the wider Linked Art community, thereby influencing their priorities, including requirements to refine future iterations of the Linked Art model and implementations of the model in software.
 
## Do I have to take part?

No. Please note that participation is voluntary. If you do decide to take part, you may withdraw at any point for any reason before submitting your answers by closing the browser. We have included a ‘Prefer not to say’ option for each set of questions should you prefer not to answer a particular question.
 
## How will my data be used?

The data we will collect that could identify you will be personal name and title, contact details, institution name, and role. Your IP address will not be stored. We will take all reasonable measures to ensure that data remain confidential.

The responses you provide will be stored in a password-protected electronic file on University of Oxford secure servers and may be used in an anonymised or aggregated form in academic publications, conference presentations, reports for the Linked Art community, and websites. Individual responses will not be published in an individually identifiable or attributable form. Identifiable information data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the research, and by 31 October 2022 at the latest.  Research data will be stored for three years after publication or public release of the work of the research. Records of consent to participate will be retained until 31 October 2025.

## Who will have access to my data?

The University of Oxford is the data controller with respect to your personal data and, as such, will determine how your personal data is used in the study. The University will process your personal data for the purpose of the research outlined above. Research is a task that we perform in the public interest. Further information about your rights with respect to your personal data is available from [https://compliance.admin.ox.ac.uk/individual-rights](https://compliance.admin.ox.ac.uk/individual-rights).

The data you provide will be available for review with project researchers Tanya Gray and Kevin Page.

We would also like to use the data, in an anonymised or aggregated form, in future studies and to share this data with other researchers (e.g. in online databases). Data will be de-identified before it is shared with other researchers or results are made public.

## Who has reviewed this study?

This project has been reviewed by, and received ethics clearance through, a subcommittee of the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee - Medical Sciences Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee (MS IDREC). Reference: R767307/RE001

# Questionnaire

The Linked Art questionnaire seeks views from all interested persons on the use and adoption of Linked Art, particularly of any opportunities and challenges that can be forseen. 

The questionnaire has been produced by the Linked Art II project at the University of Oxford, and comprises four sections:

## Section 1 - Improving Collections Data
Can Linked Art help improve collections data across institutions?

## Section 2 - Exploring Technical Implementations (optional)
Feedback on interactive notebooks developed by the project to illuminate the process of creating, reconciling, and visualising Linked Art data.

## Section 3 - Opportunities
Your ideas for specific applications of Linked Art which could support your collections data or scholarship, along with an opportunity for the project to help you implement these ideas.

## Section 4 - About Yourself
To help us understand your background and motivations.

The questionnaire will be available via the following link:
