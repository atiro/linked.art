## Introduction

These terms are required to be used in order to facilitate even the most basic understanding of the data. If a term is listed here then you MUST NOT use a different term for the same concept, as systems are expecting these terms. This is not to say that you MUST always have the terms in every record, you might not know (for example) the shape of an object, but if you do know it, then you must use the agreed upon URI for the concept of "shape".

## Summary

For brevity in the table, the AAT URI is compacted with a namespace, however the full URI **MUST** be used in the data. For example, the URI for Primary Name is `http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300404670`
